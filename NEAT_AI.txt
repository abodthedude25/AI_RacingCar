NEAT stands for Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies
we start with 100 cars with 100 random neural networks.
and from all of cars we choose 3 best neural networks.
and use them for 100 new cars.
this proccess countinues ... .

previous neural networks we did gave the data and computer started building neural network.
but here the network is made in some steps.
